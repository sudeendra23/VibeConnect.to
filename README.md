## Introduction

VibeConnect, created by Vishal Myla, is a state-of-the-art video chatting application that facilitates face-to-face conversations over the internet. Whether for remote work, online education, healthcare services, or social networking, VibeConnect leverages WebRTC technology to provide a reliable and high-fidelity communication experience.
Real-time communication tools have become essential to interpersonal and professional relationships in today's fast-paced digital environment. The Video Chat Application, which provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for audio and video discussions, represents a significant leap in this field. This programme offers direct peer-to-peer communications without the need for a centralized server by utilizing WebRTC technology. This strategy guarantees low-latency, high-quality communication while simultaneously enhancing privacy.

## Features

- Real-time video and audio communication
- Dynamic bandwidth allocation for optimized network usage
- Intelligent codec selection based on device capabilities and network conditions
- Cross-platform compatibility with responsive web design principles
- Secure peer-to-peer connections without the need for a centralized server

## Architecture

The application's architecture is built on WebRTC technology, featuring a robust signaling server using Node.js and Socket.IO. Enhanced ICE traversal algorithms, dynamic bandwidth allocation, and intelligent codec selection contribute to a smooth and efficient communication experience.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture, please refer to the Architecture section in the [project documentation](https://vishalmyla.github.io/VibeConnectDocs/).

## Implementation

The implementation details are outlined in the Implementation section of the [project documentation](https://vishalmyla.github.io/VibeConnectDocs/). Key files include:

- `Lobby.js`: Manages user authentication and room creation.
- `Room.js`: Acts as a container for users in a specific room, handling video calls and file transfers.
- `Peer.js`: Implements WebRTC functionalities, including ICE traversal, media stream handling, and intelligent codec selection.
- `Server.js`: Configures the signaling server using Node.js and Socket.IO.
